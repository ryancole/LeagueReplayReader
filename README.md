The upcoming replay feature, of [League of Legends](http://na.leagueoflegends.com/), allows you to watch replays
of recently played games. You may also download the replay, in a .rofl file, for later viewing.

This program takes a .rofl file as input and extracts out the replay's chunk and keyframe data. The chunk and
keyframe data are what the League of Legends client uses to re-enact a given replay.
